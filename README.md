# Houndhaven
A site redesign for a local dog rescue

This redesign is written in semantic HTML, utilitzes PHP templates for site uniformity, loads 80% faster than the current homepage, and includes design elements deemed important by both internal and external stakeholders.  The site is responsive thanks to Bootstrap.  Future plans are to integrate this design into a WordPress template for use on the actual website.
