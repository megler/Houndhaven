## Houndhaven
A site redesign for a local dog rescue

# Site

- Redesign: http://rutledgewebdev.com/portfolio/houndhaven/
- Current: http://houndhaven.org

# Goals
The current site is very cluttered, confusing at times, and loads slowly.  The goal of this project was to address those issues through an iterative collaboration with stakeholders.

# What I Did

This site was an exercise in site redesign from a planning and execution perspective.  During this project, I performed the following:

- Researched multiple rescue sites and related sites to get ideas for improvements.
- Created 3 personas that visit the site - volunteer, potential adopter, and organization supporter.
- Interviewed the all three persona types as well as the site owner to determine what their needs and wants were.
- Took interview results and incorprated a user journey into each persona.
- Laid out possible information architecture with known content to best determine what content was most important for each page.
- Performed card sorts with all 3 persona types to determine what was most important for navigation and homepage layout.
- With these 3 personas and branding guidelines in mind, I created multiple wireframe iterations starting with lo-fi to determine layout     and iterating to hi-fi for final design signoffs.
- Created branding guidelines to inform on color, typography, and logo usage.
- Iterated through the inital design process by performing user testing on a working full homepage layout with no color.
- Continued iteration process through final design signoff.

# The Result

This redesign:

- Written in semantic HTML
- Utilitzes PHP templates for site uniformity
- Loads 80% faster than the current homepage
- Includes design elements deemed important by both internal and external stakeholders.  
- The site is responsive thanks to Bootstrap.

# What I Learned

Collaborating with stakeholders throughout the design process and avoiding the "big reveal" cuts down on end stage surprises and unforeseen major revisions late in the project.  The client feels more involved, the heavy redesign work happens early in the project versus at the end, and the final result is more organic.

# The Future

Future plans are to integrate this design into a WordPress template for use on the actual website.  There are better ways to layout a site than Bootstrap, but that was not the purpose of this exercise.  When the move is made to WordPress, I intend to write a custom template using CSS Grid and Flexbox without the additional overhead of Bootstrap.  Also, styling will be done with RWD 2.0 techniques such as CSS Custom properties, responsive type-sets as well as a pre-processor (SASS) and a custom workflow utilizing NPM.
