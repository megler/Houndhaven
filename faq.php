					<h3 class="paraHead">Where Do Our Dogs Come From?</h3>
					<p>Our dogs come from high kill shelters throughout Lake and Sumter counties.  We also accept very limited family surrenders, though this is the exception to the rule.  When a new dog arrives, they are usually very scared and wary of humans.  This is when our volunteers shine.  Usually within 24-48 hours, the new arrival begins to understand they are in no danger as they are showered with love (and get a bath!)  Their tails slowly perk up and after a couple days are wagging and happy!</p>
					<h3 class="paraHead">What Type of Medical Care Do They Receive?</h3>
					<p>New dogs are quarantined for 10 days while we monitor for health issues such as kennel cough, which is highly contagious to other dogs.  During this time, we also take the dog to the vet for a physical and any necessary vaccinations.  Many dogs come to us with extreme medical issues.  They may have been hit by a car and have broken bones, they could be severely malnourished, they could have cancer or other issues.  We will go to extreme lengths to medically save a dog, which is why <a href="donate.php">our donors and supporters are so vitally important.</a>  Finally, they are microchipped, spayed, and neutered.</p>
					<h3 class="paraHead">When Does A Dog Become Available?</h3>
					<p>When the dog's quarantine is complete and they have healed from being spayed/neutered, they become available for adoption.  Dogs who come scared of everything come out of their shells and begin new lives as Houndhaven alums!</p>
