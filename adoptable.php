					<p>Hopper is such a lovebug! It would be very hard to find a more affectionate dog. He wants hugs, kind words, and more hugs from everyone. He’s a two year old male yellow lab mix. Hopper weighs 80 lbs. and was picked up by animal control as a stray. He loves to “sit” and sweetly “give paw”. Once he’s neutered, he’ll be ready for adoption. But you don’t have to wait and can apply for Hopper right now by reviewing our policies and submitting a completed application.</p>

					<p>Marshall has the sweetest kissable face with a personality to match. According to his previous owners (who surrendered him to animal control), this poor guy was hit by a car about a year ago which resulted in him suffering a hip injury and not being able to put any weight on his right rear leg all this time. They were unable to get him the veterinary care he needed for his injury.</p>
					<p>We immediately took him to specialist and he has had FHO surgery on that hip and will have to go through quite a bit of physical therapy. We know he will stay as sweet as ever. Marshall is a two year old male yellow lab mix that weighs about 41 lbs. He’s a very social guy and is a great car rider, too. He would love to be a part of a family. To start the adoption process for Marshall, please submit a completed application. If you would like to help with his medical expenses, <a href="donate.php">any donation will be appreciated.</a></p>

					<p>Gunther was picked up by animal services. He and a beagle were found together. The beagle was reclaimed but Gunther wasn’t. He’s a five year old male black lab, already neutered, and heartworm negative. He is a very good looking guy with a coat that shines and bright eyes. Gunther weighs 72 lbs. and is now up to date on vaccines and has been started on monthly heartworm prevention. If you are looking for a devoted companion, submit a completed application to adopt handsome Gunther.</p>

					<p>Tramp is a very polite boy. Without any prompting, he’ll sit on his own and patiently wait while he gets his leash put on to go out for a walk. And when he comes back from his walk, he sits quietly while you close his kennel door. He already knows the “sit” and “down” commands. He is a three year old black lab mix. He weighs 53 lbs. and we will have him neutered. Tramp wants to be friends with everyone. To adopt super sweet Tramp, review our policies and submit a completed application.</p>
